Hi,

<p>Seems like the helpdesk server is down. Somebody tried reaching the support/sales, but since it was down he/she was unable to. Meanwhile, you can find his/her details below: </p>

<table>
  <body>
    <tr>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td><?= $person_name ?></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Email</td>
      <td><?= $person_email ?></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td><?= $custom_ticket_fields_field_1 ?></td>
